# Starting Ten

We first started the game in 2012, a fork of a different game from a forum. The original game had you pick five players and you only got points for their scores for the whole tournament. We wanted to inject a bit of chaos into the model, so we added five players, and gave you points for the seed *and* the round of the tournament.

You can learn more about one group that forked our idea, from a [Vice Sports article.
